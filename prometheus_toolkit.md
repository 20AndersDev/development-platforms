## Introduction

Prometheus is an Open-Source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit that collects and stores it's numeric measurements as a time series data, information is stored with the timestamp at which it was recorded, alongside optional key-value paris called labels. 

By the use of a multi-dimensional data model, data can be sliced and diced at will, along dimensions like instance, service, endpoint, and method.
It is based on a principal of Operational simplicity, so that you can spin up a monitoring server where and when you want, even as a local server at home on your desktop computer. This without setting up a distributed storage backend or reconfiguring the world. 

## Brief History
Prometheus is an open-source project built at [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/discover). Since it's creation in 2012, there has been alot of updates and improvement on the system. It's now a standalone open-source project and maintained independently of any company. 
Prometheus joined the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) in 2016 as the second hosted project, after [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).
