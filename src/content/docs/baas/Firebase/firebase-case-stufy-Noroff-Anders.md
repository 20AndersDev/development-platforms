## Introduction

Firebase is an Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform developed by Google. It provides a wide range of services for app developers, including authentication, databases, hosting, and alot of other useful features. 

Firebase is a great tool for developers who want to focus on building their app, rather than spending time on maintaining the backend.

## Brief History


- 2011: James Tamplin and Andrew Lee founded Firebase as a separate company from another comapanyy they founded a year before named Envolve. Envolve was an API that allowed developers to integrate chat into their apps but developers was using it for other purposes than chat like sync application data such as game state in real time across their users. Tamplin and Lee noticed this and decided to pivot the company to focus on the real-time database product and named it Firebase.

- 2014-2015: Firebase i acquired by Google and launches two new products: Firebase Hosting and Firebase Authentichation. In 2015  Google aquires  Divshot wich is an HTML hosting service and integrates it into Firebase Hosting.

- 2016: Firebase analytics is annouced. Google aslo annouced that they are expanding its services to become a unified backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform for mobile developers.

- 2017 - today: Firebase continues to grow and expand its services. Google annouces that they are expanding the platform to web developers and annouces that they are adding support for web applications. Today Firebase is a popular choice for developers who want to build apps for both mobile and web.
