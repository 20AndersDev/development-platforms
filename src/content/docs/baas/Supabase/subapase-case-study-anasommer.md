| Hosted Postgres database         | Allows to store and manage application's data. Postgres is a powerful, reliable, and feature-rich relational database system with a proven track record in the industry. Working with the Postgres tables inside Supabase takes a minimal understanding of SQL.                                                                              |
| Authentication and Authorization | A robust authentication and authorization system that allows to secure the application and control user access. User registration, login and password recovery can be easily managed using Supabase's authentication API's. Access control rules can be defined to restrict access to specific resources based on user roles and permissions |
| Auto-generated API's             | Supabase simplifies the process of building APIs for the application by automatically generating REST and GraphQL APIs based on the users database schema. It also enables seamless integration with front-end frameworks and libraries.                                                                                                     |
