## Introduction

ChatGPT is a natural language processing tool developed by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), released in November 2022. Since its release, it has gained worldwide traction from the tech-industry and the general public. The chatbot can answer open ended questions, and assist users with tasks. Many are amazed about how human-like ChatGPTs responses are, and some are concerned about their jobs being threatened in the near future.

ChatGPT is a natural language processing (NLP) tool driven by artificial intelligence technology. Due to being a NLP tool, the chatbot is trained to predict the next most likely word occurring in a given sentence. The big selling point of ChatGPT is that its input comes from a diverse range of sources including news articles, websites, and books.

## Brief History

ChatGPT is part of a family of models developed by OpenAI that use the _Generative Pre-trained Transformer_ (GPT) architecture. The original GPT model was released in 2018, with each iteration improving the quality of the generated text. The history of ChatGPT itself is short, but there are some previous events that contribute to understanding where ChatGPT, chatbots and AI is today.

- 1950s: Alan Turing, the pioneering British computer scientist, publishes “Computing Machinery and Intelligence”, where he proposes that if a machine can convince a human they're talking to another human, then the machine has intelligence. Later this year, he developed a test called the “Turing Test” to assess machine intelligence.

- 1966: Joseph Weizenbaum, a German computer scientist and Professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, developed the program ELIZA inspired by Turing's paper. Eliza's purpose was to trick humans into believing they were chatting with another human and it's considered the first chat bot in human history. It didn't pass the Turing Test.

- 1972: Kenneth Colby, a professor of psychiatry at Stanford University, develops Parry to study the human mind through computer models.

- 1983: William Chamberlain and Thomas Etter create RACTER, a chat bot whose aim is to entertain people who interact with it.

- 2000s: ALICE (Artificial Language Internet Computer Entity) was developed. Although it didn't pass the Turing Test, it became the foundation for most chatbots that exist today.

- 2010: Apple launches their virtual assistant Siri.

- 23rd March 2016: Microsoft releases Tay, a Twitter chat bot that was shut down shortly after because it learnt offensive language.

- 6th November 2016: Amazon launches their virtual assistant Alexa.

- 11th June 2018: OpenAI releases "Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training", a paper presenting the differences between natural language processing (NLP) models and GPT.

- November 2019: OpenAI launches GPT-2 as a "direct scale-up" of GPT.

- July 2020: GPT-3 is introduced in beta testing mode.

- 29th June 2021: GitHub releases GitHub Copilot, developed in collaboration with OpenAI and based on GPT-3.

- 5th August 2022: Meta launches Blenderbot 3, the company's most advanced AI chatbot to date.

- 30th November 2022: OpenAI launches ChatGPT based on the GPT-3.5 model. It gained 1 million users within 5 days of its release, whereas other successful applications needed months to achieve the first million users. For instance, Netflix achieved its first million in 40 months, Facebook in 10 months, and Instagram in 2.5 months.

- February 2023: Meta AI releases LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI).

- February 6, 2023: Google announces Bard, a conversational chatbot AI powered by Meta AI's LLaMA.

- March 14, 2023: OpenAI releases GPT-4; available via ChatGPT Plus and a commercial API.

- March 30, 2023: Introduction of AutoGPT.

- 2023: Release of BabyAGI and JARVIS/HuggingGPT.

- Late 2023: OpenAI secures a $10 billion deal with Microsoft; expands ChatGPT to various industries and global markets.

- December 2023: Reopening of ChatGPT Plus subscriptions and strategic partnership announcements.

## Features

ChatGPT has the ability to remember previous questions asked in a chat, enabling it to effectively interact with humans in a conversational manner. The model was trained on a vast amount of corpus data covering a wide range of topics and styles, making its potential uses diverse.

When asked about what tasks it could assist with (screenshot #1), ChatGPT answered:

```
ChatGPT-4 can assist with a wide range of tasks, including:

1. **Complex Query Resolution**: Providing detailed answers to intricate queries with context awareness.
2. **Writing Assistance**: Helping in various writing tasks, from creative compositions to technical documents.
3. **Language Translation**: Translating text across multiple languages, even with complex content.
4. **Creative Projects**: Generating ideas and content for creative works like stories, scripts, and poetry.
5. **Information Retrieval**: Fetching relevant information from various databases and internet sources.
6. **Personalized Recommendations**: Offering tailored advice based on user preferences and behavior.
7. **Customer Service**: Assisting with inquiries and supporting diverse products and services.
8. **Educational Tutoring**: Providing explanations and help in educational subjects.
9. **Programming Assistance**: Generating, reviewing, and debugging code in various languages.
10. **Web Searching with Bing**: Conducting web searches for real-time internet information.
11. **Integration with DALL-E**: Collaborating for tasks involving text and image generation.

These are just a few examples of the many tasks that ChatGPT-4 can help with.

The bot can produce human-like text in several languages, making it suitable for writing essays, poems, bedtime stories, news articles, and even scientific abstracts. The information provided by ChatGPT might not be reliable in all cases, but the text bot is able to mimic academic language perfectly. It can also improve grammar, explain complex ideas in simple terms, and solve mathematical problems, making it a suitable tool for students who need assistance with their assignments.

One of the most relevant features for web and software development is its ability to generate code snippets in different programming languages including JavaScript, Java, Python, C++, C#, and Ruby. A myriad of videos can be found on YouTube explaining how ChatGPT built entire apps for them. Although there's been a continuos improvement to GPT's code generating abilities, with the current GPT-4 version being more accurate and better at more complex problem solving, human oversight still remains crucial to detect problems and inaccuracies. Therefore, the building process requires a human developer behind it who can either debug or give further instructions to ChatGPT on how it can fix its own bugs. Nevertheless, the bot has proven to be an exceptional debugging assistant tool. Since resolving code issues involves a lot of time spent on reading documentation, Google searches, and StackOverflow, ChatGPT can significantly increase developers productivity by providing possible solutions in a matter of seconds. All the developer needs to do is copy/paste the code into the chat line and explain what it's supposed to do and what error it's throwing.

ChatGPT now offers both a free version as well as a paid subscription version (ChatGPT Plus). Benefits of the subscription plan includes:

- Faster response times (especially during peak hours)
- An increased reliability, where downtime and performance issues are less likely
- Early access to new features, updates and beta-versions
- A higher usage limit, compared to the free version

Current cost of the subscription version is $20 per month, with a slightly higher cost in the EU (due to taxes) of $23.80.

OpenAI have released an API for accessing the AI models they have developed. On their [official website](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) they state:
'_Unlike most AI systems which are designed for one use-case, the API today provides a general-purpose “text in, text out” interface, allowing users to try it on virtually any English language task. You can now request access in order to integrate the API into your product, develop an entirely new application, or help us explore the strengths and limits of this technology._'

The API will return a text completion, from a given text prompt, attempting to match the pattern it was given. It can be "programmed" by providing some examples of what you'd like it to do. The API currently runs models with weights from the GPT-4 family.
