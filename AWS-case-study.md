## Introduction

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources

In this study case i will be looking into the biggest provider of Cloud services Amazon Web Services (AWS), and have a closer look at using AWS Amplify as a BaaS platform

  * AWS started offering web-based computing infrastructure services, now known as cloud computing.

* 2008 
  * Google announced App Engine, a developer tool that allowed users to run web applications on Google infrastructure.

* 2010 
  * Microsoft released Azure, its cloud computing service.

* 2011
  * IBM introduced the SmartCloud framework.

* 2015
