### Summarizes the product's primary purpose in one or two paragraphs.

Vite JS was created as a building tool for frontend development and the goal is to give the developers an faster and a more satisfy
experience for modern web projects.

In this case you will be reading about the strengths and weaknesses of choosing Vite js as a building tool.


## Brief History

### Vite.js development platform


- Provide a brief history of the product, including major milestones or events.
You may use bullet points, numbered lists, paragraphs or a timeline.

Vite is an relatively new frontend tooling that was first launched in 2020 by Evan You, the creator of Vue js.
The goal of this building tool is to speed up the process of using a frontend tool and building to the production.
Vite comes with esbuild that's bundling the dependencies during the development and makes the bundling extremely quick compared to other frontend tooling package.

A key functions that's have made vite so successfully is the advantage of using native ES modules that's is supported in almost all
moderne web-browsers. With this key function and together with esbuild vite is able to just process that specific file/code that's is provided to the page in the browser instead of load all of the code that's not is in use on that specific page. 

### Milestone

Vite.js does not have any official reported milestones on theirs own homepage, but I would still say that's there are some few that's is worth to mentation.

### Vite vs. competitor

Vite is new in the marked were there are a couple of well-known bundlers for many years, but Vite.js has managed to become famous for it's incredible simplicity and for the speed.
A competitor with the name Snowpack is a competitor that's was launched in the same year as Vite and has similarly functionality and features has also been growing during the last years but
not in the same numbers as Vite. Stats from npm trends shows that Vite has totally 3 292 426 downloads and Snowpack has only 20 251 downloads on 05.02.2023.

- Vite (3 years)
- Snowpack (3 years)
- Parcel (8 years)
- Webpack (11) years)

## Features

Outline the product's key features.

- Fast building process, Vite.js uses the advantage of using ES modules which improves the building process, even for larger projects.
- Using esbuild which re-building the dependencies during the development.
- Uses Rollup when it's time to build for the production.
- No bundler is required, Vite.js does not require any bundler to be used which will make the setup process easy & quick.

## Strengths

The strength with Vite is the uses of Hot Module Replace together with native ES modules which will speed up the building process for the developers. This will reconstruction only the file's or code that's have been changed and will there will not be needed to re-build the hole packaged. 
Tt's will also an positive affect for the end-user in the end as well. The webpage is only loading the information that's is needed with EM modules. 

## Weaknesses


Something that's is important to remember is that Vite is still pretty new in the marked and even if they have had an explosive growing the last month/year will there still be some weaknesses compered to others.
If we are looking into plugins we will have some limitations at Vite. 

- Plugins
    - As an example does Vite js have 6 official plugins available on their webpage and if we compere with Webpack js that's have 23 plugins available
