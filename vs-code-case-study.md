## Introduction

## Brief History
  
  Here is a breif timeline of the history of VS Code
  
  - 2011: Microsoft released a lightweight editor called "Monaco" as part of Azure Cloud Shell.
  - 2013: Microsoft began developing a more robust version of Monaco to be used for desktop applications.
  - 2015: VS Code was released to the public as a free and open-Source code editor.
  - 2016: Visual Studio Code won the Editor's Choice award by PCMag.
  - 2017: VS Code became the most popular development enviroment, overtaking JetBrains IntelliJ, it was also the top choice for code editing in the Stack Overflow developer survey.
  - 2018 Visual Studio Code Marketplace reached the astonishing 1 million downloads per week.
  - 2019: Microsoft released an online version of VS Code called "Visual Studio Online" for cloud-based development.
  - 2021: Visual Studio Code introduced support for Apples new silicon processors, allowing it to run natively on the new architecture.

## Main Features

### Live Share

### Web IDE

### Extensions

### Debugging

### Source Control 

Visual Studio Code has a built-in support for source control, this allows developers to manage changes to their code over time. It is an important feature for developers as it allows them to track changes to their codebase, collaborate with other developers, and revert changes if necessary.
The source control functionality is based on Git, which is a popular distributed version control system that is widely used in the development industry, Git allows developers to create multiple branches of their codebase, which makes it possible for developers to work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. Changes to the code can be commited to the local Git repository, then pushed to a remote repository for sharing with fellow developers.

In VSCode, the source control functionally is easily accessed through the **Source Control Panel**, which can be opned by clicking on the icon that looks like a branch with a circle around it in the left-hand sidebar. From here, you can create new branches, commit changes, push changes and view the status of their git repository. 

Additionally, VSCode has several features that make working with source control easier and more efficient. Heres some examples, it provides visual cues in the editor to show which lines have been added, removed or modified since last commit. It also provides a visual difference (diff) tool, which allows you to see the differences between different versions your code. Last but not least, it has a intergrated support for pull requests and code reviews, this allows teams to collaborate on code changes and ensure that changes are reviewd and tested before they are merged into the main codebase.


### Syntax Highlighting
  
Syntax highlighting is a common feature is most modern code editors, including VS Code. It helps make code easier to read and understand by visually distingushing    different components of the code. Syntax highlighting does as exactly what you would expect from reading the name, it highlights different elements of the code with distinct colors or styles, sutch as strings, comments, keywords, variables and more. this makes it easier for developers to visually see  differences between components of the code, which can be very helpful when working with large codebases or trying to debug issues in the code.

Another great feature with syntax highlighting is that it's often customizable, allowing developers to change the colors and styles for different elements of the code. This can be specially useful for developers who have different preferences or visual needs. Some code editors may even have different themes or styles that can be applied to the syntax feature, allowing developers to quickly switch between different styles.
  
Making the code easier to read is only one of the great features of syntax highlighting, another great feature is it's ability to help you prevent errors by highlighting potential mistakes or inconsistencies in the code. For example, if a variable is misspelled, the syntax highlighting would give a different color than normal, which would indicate that it is not recognized as a variable. This can help developers catch mistakes early, and making it easier to fix issues and typos before they cause larger problems down the line.
  
Overall, syntax highlighting is an important feature of VS Code that can help make coding easier, faster and more efficent. By visually distingushing different components of the code, syntax highlighting can help developers read and understand code more easily, catch mistakes early on, and improve the overall quality of their code.

### Code Refactoring
 
Code refactoring is about improving code quality by making it more efficient, readable and maintainable. VSCode has several built-in tools to help you with this. These tools allow developers to modify exsiting code without changing its behavior or functionality.
  
Some of the code refactoring features in VSCode include these features:
  
  - **Renaming**: Imagine you want to change the name of a variable, function or class, but you have lost control of all the places you have used it. This feature allows you to change the name trough out your entire code base with a single action. This makes it easier to maintain consistency and clarity within the codebase.
Simply press **F2** or right click on the code and select **Rename Symbol** to use this feature.

  - **Extracting code**: Extracting code refers to the process of taking a piece of code and turning it into a separate function, variable or class. This can help make the code more modular and reusable.
  
In VSCode, the process of extracting code is often called "The Extact Method" or "Extract Function". This can be done with the use of an extenstion, for example "JavaScript ES6 code snippets", which includes a shortcut for extracting code. It is also possible to do this without the use of an extenstion, select the code you wish to extract, right click on it, and choose "Refactor > Extract Method/Function" from the context menu.
