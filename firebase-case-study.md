# Firebase Case Study

## Introduction

Summary of products' primary purpose

Firebase is a cloud based development platform provided by Google. Firebase was created by James Tamplin and Andrew Lee at Envolve in 2011 to funnel data storage and data transfer into one realtime system for the companys chat service. In 2012 Firebase goes public as a separate company to Envolve, and in 2014 Firebase is acquired by Google. The short version of Firebase is that it provides a complete Software Development Kit, or SDK, across multible platforms to create applications with, providing cloud based solutions such as storage, hosting, and serverless computing. This allows developers to focus on building applications without having to worry about managing and maintaining servers or scaling.

## Brief History

A brief history of the product, including major milestones or events

- 2011: Firebase is created to funnel data storage and data transfer into one realtime system for Envolves' chat service.
- 2012: Firebase goes public with Realtime Database as their first product.
- 2014: Firebase launches two new products: Firebase Authentication and Firebase Hosting.
- 2014: Firebase is acquired by Google.
- 2016: Firebase expands their product portfolio with Firebase Analytics, Cloud Messaging, Test Lab and Crash Reporting, Notifications, Dynamic Links, Invites, App Indexing, AdWords and AdMob, introduces a new console, new SDK, and moves their documentation.
- 2017: Firebase launches Cloud Firestore, a realtime document database that can synchronize data across platforms.

## Features

Outline the products key features

The Firebase portfolio of products is divided into three categories: build, release & monitor, and engage. Each category has their own suite of products, tools, and integrations. To best illustrate the size of Firebases' portfolio, I will discuss and elaborate on their products and services by category.

### Build

The Build category hosts the backbone of Firebases' entire portfolio since its inception: the Realtime Database and Cloud Firestore. Cloud Firestore is the next evolution of Realtime Database and Firebase still serves and maintains Realtime Database in their product portfolio as one of their featured products. The Realtime Database is a NoSQL database that stores data in a JSON tree, whereas Cloud Firestore is a NoSQL document database. This essentially means that data is stored in documents, which can then be organized into collections. Because data is stored in collections rather than table rather than tables and rows like SQL databases, a database can be scaled horizontally rather than vertically, which causes less performance issues for the servers. Storing data in collections of documents then, reduces the complexity at scale that a JSON tree can cause. The short version of the differences in the data models between Realtime Database and Cloud Firestore is that Firestores' data model reduces complexity, especially at scale.

Automatic scaling - scales horizontally rather than vertically
