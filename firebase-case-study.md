## Brief History

- ***Firebase*** originated with *Envolve*, a startup founded in the company in 2011 by Andrew Lee and James Tamplin.

- The company offered an API for developers to facilitate the integration of online chats into websites. Envolve's founders noticed that their chat service was being used to forward non-chat messages.

- Developers relied on the platform to synchronize application data in real-time. Lee and Tamplin decided to separate the differentiate real-time architecture from the chat system, which led to the creation of Firebase in 2011. The *Firebase Backend-as-a-Service* platform was unveiled to the public and launched in April 2012.

- The first *Firebase* product launched to hit the market was the **Realtime Database**. This is an API for synchronizing application data between Android synchronization, Web, and iOS devices. Application developers can rely on the platform to create collaborative real-time applications.
