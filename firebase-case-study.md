## Introduction

## *What is **Firebase**?*

![Firebase](images/firebase.jpeg)

## **Firebase**

A mobile development platform with features that help both developers work efficiently, fast, and reliably, solving the three main issues in mobile apps and all multi-platform devices. It was a backend platform that enhanced the developer's reliance on using it based on demand. It is a leading platform that is relied on by developers globally. It has rapid improvements and additional features that will give satisfying results for the knowledge of both developers and users. And since it is cloud-hosted, it will provide a smoother performance for demand scaling without any hassles. All features are functions for both mobile and web-based applications, including services for building, testing, and managing apps.

## Brief History

- ***Firebase*** originated with *Envolve*, a startup founded in the company in 2011 by Andrew Lee and James Tamplin.

- The company offered an API for developers to facilitate the integration of online chats into websites. Envolve's founders noticed that their chat service was used to forward non-chat messages.

- Developers relied on the platform to synchronize application data in real-time. Lee and Tamplin decided to separate the differentiate real-time architecture from the chat system, which led to the creation of Firebase in 2011. The *Firebase Backend-as-a-Service* platform was unveiled to the public and launched in April 2012.

- The first *Firebase* product launched to hit the market was the **Realtime Database**. This is an API for synchronizing application data between Android synchronization, Web, and iOS devices. Application developers can rely on the platform to create collaborative real-time applications.

### **App-Building Services**

- *Real-time database* - Updates, stores, and sync data between your users. The data is stored as JSON and synchronized with each connected client in real-time. It captures, collects, processes, and enriches incoming data points after they have been made. Data velocity continues to increase and accelerate and now relies more heavily on real-time database technologies. Real-time processing to process handle workloads whose state is constantly changing. Transactions in real-time processing are completed so quickly that the result can be retrieved and processed immediately.

- *Cloud Firestore* - is a NoSQL document database for the client- and server-side apps document-oriented database. One of the unique features is the syncing of data across multiple client apps using real-time listeners. It supports various file types, numbers, strings, and nested objects. It is secure, reliable, and integrates seamlessly with Firebase and the Google Cloud Platform. It also provides support for offline access, which is especially useful for mobile apps.

- *Cloud Functions* - is a tool for building the mobile app that lets you automatically run backend code in response to trigger events and enables you to firebase features and HTTPS requests. It allows you to write small pieces of JavaScript, which has been the most requested feature.

- *Cloud Storage* - is designed for application developers who need to store and serve user-generated content, usually big files like photos or videos. It is a technology that allows storing and managing various media content generated by mobile app users. It is a cloud computing model that holds data on the internet through a cloud computing provider that organizes and operates data storage. We can use Google Cloud Storage to access the duplicate files on the server. It provides agility, durability, and global scale with "anywhere, anytime" data access.

- *Hosting* - is responsible for providing static and dynamic content and microservices. Can quickly deploy web apps with a single command. It allows us to migrate Firebase hosting content into our domain with SSL security.

- *Authentication* - is one of the most critical requirements for Android apps. It provides all the server-side stuff for authenticating the user, and it is much more complicated if we have to write all this code ourselves. These features can be easily integrated with your custom backend. It also provides some user interface libraries that enable screens for us when logging in.

- *Firebase Machine Learning Kit* - is a powerful yet easy-to-use package, simple, easy, and quick to add to any application. Not only this, but the chances of errors are also significantly reduced. The best part of implementing this SDK is that you do not have to write much code. It applies Google Analytics for Firebase data to create groups of users based on predicted behavior. It is updated daily and can use for targeting with notifications, remote configuration, and more. It provides users with features of Machine Learning such as Face Recognizance, Language Translator, etc.

### **Testing-Maintaining Services**

- *Firebase Test Lab* - it is a cloud-based service infrastructure that ensures your app quality. It initiates testing of your app across various devices and device configurations with one operation. Instruments used for testing are real production devices. The mobile platform has evolved rapidly. Firebase Test Lab installs the application on a device hosted in a Google data center. You can target a specific device and run your application to determine the issues.

- *Firebase Crashlytics* -  is a  Firebase feature to support developers. It helps collect, analyze, diagnose, organize, and manage crashes and crash reports that are destroying our app's quality performance. When an issue suddenly increases rapidly, the developers get alerts and can figure out which lines of code are causing crashes.

- *Firebase Performance Monitoring* - is an assistance for collecting and giving insights into how the performance data of your mobile and web apps are in real users' hands, then reviewing and analyzing that data in the Firebase console. It helps you to understand in real time where your app's performance can be improved so that you can use that information to fix performance issues. It is a savior service when an application is experiencing crashes due to memory issues during network calls, or even if the app is not fluid and is experiencing glitches in graphical redraw processes, and so on.

- *App Distribution* - is a unique solution to help you test cross-platform, allowing you to upload and distribute your apps to trusted testers or QA from your team to execute the process called pre-release app distribution, which is an effective option to advertise the applications.

### **Business Instruments**

- *Google Analytics* - provides a free app measurement solution for comprehensive in-app behavioral and marketing analytics on mobile apps, how users engage with your app, and its marketing performance in app usage and user engagement. The analytics reports help you understand how your users behave, enabling you to make informed decisions regarding app marketing and performance optimizations.

- *Predictions* - is a tool that uses the app's analytical data to predict or anticipate user actions. It is a service from Firebase that assists users in predicting behaviors employing Machine Learning technologies. It learns the analytical data to develop dynamic user segments based on users' predicted behavior. It will make it easier to analyze data. This feature can retain users who would have otherwise uninstalled an app. It uses the power of Google's machine learning to create dynamic user groups based on users' predicted behavior.

- *Cloud Messaging* -
