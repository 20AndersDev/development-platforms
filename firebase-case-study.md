# Introduction

## *What is **Firebase**?*

![Firebase](images/firebase.jpeg)

## **Firebase**

- It is a mobile application development platform. It is a backend platform for building web and mobile applications.

- Fundamentally a collection of tools developers can rely on, creating applications and expanding them based on demand.

___________________________________________________________________

## Brief History

- **Firebase** is an evolution from the start-up prior called *Envolve* which is founded by James Tamplin and Andrew Lee.

- After they discover that the chat service was utilized for relaying non-chat messages, they decided to differentiate the real-time architecture from the chat system, a move which led to Firebase being founded in 2011.

- Then in April 2012, they publicly launch the *Firebase* backend as a service platform.

- **Realtime Database** was the first product that Firebase launched. It is an API for application data synchronization across Android, web, and iOS devices that can rely on the platform for creating collaborative real-time applications.

- In 2014, they launched the *Firebase Authentication* and *Firebase Hosting* for establishing the company as a leading *mobile backend as a service*(MbaaS).

- In October 2014, the *Firebase* become part of the Google Baas platform. And in October 2015, Google acquired Divshot, an HTML5 web-hosting platform, to merge it with Firebase.

- By 2017, *Firebase Analytics* was introduced to become a unified backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform for mobile developers.

- As the years passed by, many improvements and additional features had been added to the list of Firebase achievements. (Resources links are added below for you to read more about it!).

- **Build** is an expansive feature set of Firebase with various components that enable developers to stay on top of their application development requirements which include data storage, handling, authentication, and machine learning.

- **Databases**
  - *Cloud Firestore* also known as Google Firestore, is a component of the Firebase mobile application development platform.

  - *Firebase Realtime Database* is a cloud-hosted database. It facilitates JSON-based data storage and performs real-time data synchronization with connected clients.

- **Machine Learning** refers to a mobile SDK that harnesses the power of Google machine learning and implements the same to the iOS and Android applications through a convenient package.

- **Firebase Cloud Functions** refer to a serverless framework that enables developers to execute backend code for responding to HTTPS and Firebase feature-triggered events.

- **Authentication** is a Firebase feature offering ready-to-use UI libraries, backends, and convenient SDKs for user application authentication. It is integrated with different Firebase services, makes use of OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0, and allows custom backend integration.

- **Firebase Cloud Messaging or FCM** refers to a cross-platform message service for free-of-cost messaging. This feature enables app owners to notify client apps when data or emails are to be synced.

- **The Cloud Storage** is a service for storing application development resources. Users gain access to Google-level upload and download security with this feature, and it is suitable for storing media files and user content.

- **Emulator Suite** allows developers for implementing all kinds of manual or automated tests of their code without inducing additional costs.

- **Release & Monitor** is a collection of Firebase features to prepare developers for the much-anticipated application launch. It comes with an array of testing, analytical, and distribution tools to ensure smooth application experiences for users.

- **Crashlytics** is used to track possible stability issues.

- **Firebase Analytics** users can use Analytics for performing unlimited reporting for multiple Firebase SDK events.

To better understand the differences between Firebase Analytics and Google Analytics, please read Firebase Analytics vs. Google Analytics.

- **Firebase Performance Monitoring** is a service that monitors and helps you to gain insight into the performance characteristics of your iOS, Android, and web apps.

- **Firebase Test Lab** is a cloud infrastructure for application testing. It lets users test their iOS and Android applications with an operation across many devices and different device configurations.

- **Firebase App Distribution** is a feature that offers a comprehensive view of a user’s beta testing program across the Android and iOS platforms.

- **Remote Config** refers to a cloud solution that enables users to modify applications’ behavior and appearance without updating them.

- **Firebase Predictions** This feature takes advantage of machine learning for data to develop dynamic user segments based on behavior.

- **A/B Testing** with this user can quickly test modifications made to UIs, features, and campaigns before app launches.

- **Firebase Dynamic Links** lets new users access content when an app gets launched initially.

- **In-App Messaging** is for engaging active app users using contextual messaging. Users can carry out specific in-app actions for accessing different features or unlocking certain offerings.

- **Free to start** getting started without any cost is a good option offered by *Firebase* and one reason it is so popular, and that users can sign in with their Google account.

- **Development Speed** provides multiple ready-to-use services like data storage, authentication, notifications, analytics, and more that will avoid a developer from creating boilerplate code, reinventing the wheel, and starting a backend from scratch that manages all the work and helps developers drastically reduce the time to market for developing apps.

- **All in one platform** it covers the entire application development cycle, and the platform contains features to build, release and monitor applications. Also, it provides tools to engage users and keep them using it.

- **Powered by Google** *Firebase* is one of the most prominent and trusted names in the world of technology. As it has gone through a series of changes and developments and become the reliable platform it is today. It is now part of the Google Cloud Platform that works in perfect harmony with other Google Cloud services and integrates with plenty of third-party services.

- **Focus on Front-End Development** the *Firebase* is focusing on creating frontend code for mobile applications that makes application development convenient and helps to keep costs low and it allows developers and companies to standardize the backend environment

- **Serverless** *Firebase* solves scaling up a database cluster and provides an entirely serverless environment as it comes with a serverless architecture that requires users to pay based on requests, and there is no requirement to manage or worry about server infrastructure.

- **Machine Learning** is advantageous as it offers developers the option to rely on machine learning as it comes with an ML kit with available APIs for different mobile platform features like text identification, face detection, image labeling, barcode scanning, and more.

- **Monitor Errors** it can monitor both non-fatal and fatal errors, and reports are generated based on how errors affect users’ experience.

- **Backups** the apps are protected from any possibility of data loss by relying on the automatic backup feature of this platform. Clicking the Backups tab of the Firebase Database gives one access to the auto-backup settings.
