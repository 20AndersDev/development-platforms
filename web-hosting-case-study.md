### Web Hosting

Web hosting is an online service that makes your website’s content accessible on the internet. When you purchase a hosting plan, you are renting space on a physical server to store all the website’s files and data.

## Brief History

When we speak about web hosting, we have to go all the way back to 1990s, which is the early days of the internet. This is when the first websites was created, launched and hosted on personal computers. Then after some time when the internet was growing in popularity and becoming bigger and more useful, the need for more robust and reliable hosting solutions emerged. We are now gonna go even more in detail about the history and major milestones of web hosting.

Some major milestones in the history of web hosting:

### 1969 - ARPANET was created

This started in the 1960s when government researches wanted to link computers in a network to basically facilitate the exchange of information between them. Under the Cold War  the efforts to link multiple computers across USA was big, as fears of a nuclear attack were growing. Because of this, information would be preserved across the network in case those locations in the country were hit. Because of this, ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) was created.The first computer was linked to the network in august 1969 at the University of California, Los Angeles.

### 1991 - First website hosted

The first website was launched and was hosted on a server at CERN (the European Organisation for Nuclear Research) in Switzerland.

### 1996 – cPanel was released

cPanel is a web hosting control panel software developed by cPanel, LLC. It provides a graphical interface (GUI) and automation tools designed to simplify the process of hosting a web site to the website owner or the "end user". This is one of the most used hosting control panels today, if not the biggest. It was created as a control panel now-defunct provider Speed Hosting. cPanel 3 was released in 1999, this included the Web Host Manager (WHM) - which is basically a server management tool. It had two levels, the root WHM was for the administrators, and the non-root WHM allowed resellers to create  hosting packages, but also manage them at the same time.

### 2006 – Amazon launched Amazon Web Services

In 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) began offering  IT infrastructure services to businesses around the USA and the world in the form of  web services, which is now known as cloud  computing. But why is AWS the biggest and most popular? It became and are the biggest because it offered a fullstack of services, user-friendly management and also a "pay-on-the-go" business modal. You remember I said AWS is the biggest and most popular? Yes thats because Amazon currently, as we speak, holds almost 50% of the cloud services market, making it way bigger than its competitors.

### 2008 -  GitHub Pages is launched.

Github created Github Pages in 2008, it`s a static web hosting service for project documentation, blogs and books etc. Github pages content is stored in a Git repository in two kinds of way, you can do it as files served to visitors verbatim, and the other way is in a markdown format.Github works trough Jekyll static website an blog generator. Basically each time the content source is updated, Jekyll regenerates the website  and automatically  serves it via Github Pages tool. Github have both free and  and paid tiers of service, which makes it very popular for school and work related stuff. Github pages supports HTTPS encryption and one one more thing to notice is that websites generated through this service are either hosted as subdomains of the Github.io domain or it can be connected to custom  domains which is bought through a third-party domain name registrar.

### 2014 – The number of websites with unique host-names passed one billion
