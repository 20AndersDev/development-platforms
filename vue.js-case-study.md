## Introduction

I've chosen Vue as my case study because frontend is what I study. I've never used Vue and I have zero experience with it, so I reckon this would be pretty interesting to dive deeper into.

## Brief History

Vue was created by Evan You, a Google software engineer, in 2013 and had its official release in 2014. The name derives from the French word vue, meaning view. Evan wanted to create a framework that was lightweight and included the best parts from Angular, which he had been using at Google.

#### Here is a timeline highlighting the major events:
 
- **2013:** Version 0.6 In December Evan You created the first version of Vue
- **2014:** Version 0.8 First public release
- **2015:** Version 1.0 Released
- **2016:** Version 2.0 Released
- **2020:** Version 3.0 Released
