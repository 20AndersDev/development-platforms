I've chosen Vue as my case study because frontend is what I study. I've never used Vue and I have zero experience with it, so I reckon this would be pretty interesting to dive deeper into.

## Brief History

Vue was created by Evan You, a Google software engineer, in 2013 and had its official release in 2014. The name derives from the French word vue, meaning view. Evan wanted to create a framework that was lightweight and included the best parts from Angular, which he had been using at Google.

#### Here is a timeline highlighting the major events:
 
- **2013:** Version 0.6 In December Evan You created the first version of Vue
- **2014:** Version 0.8 First public release
- **2015:** Version 1.0 Released
- **2016:** Version 2.0 Released
- **2020:** Version 3.0 Released

## Main Features
 
Vue is a Javascript framework used to build frontend UI. It is simple and has a small learning curve, good library support and is efficient.

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Virtual DOM | Virtual representation of the DOM tree that makes the page faster |
| Data Binding | Manipulates/assign values to HTML attributes, change style or assign classes etc. |
| Components | Create custom reusable HTML elements |
| Event Handling | Event listeners |
| Animation/Transition | Built-in wrappers and/or third party libraries for transition effects |

| Watchers | This feature does something for a specific reason. |
| Routing | |

## Market Comparison


 ### Pros
- **Small in size:** The framework is only 18kb and is fast to install.
- **Performance:** Using a virtual DOM, page rendering is pretty quick and thus improves the application's overall performance.
