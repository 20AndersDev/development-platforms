## Introduction

I've chosen Vue as my case study because I'm most interested in frontend. I use React at work on a dailly basis, but never tried Vue and thought this would be pretty interesting to dive deeper into.

## Brief History

Vue was created by Evan You, a Google software engineer, in 2013 and had its official release in 2014. The name derives from the French word vue, meaning view. Evan wanted to create a framework that was lightweight and included the best parts from Angular, which he had been using at Google.

Here is a timeline highlighting the major events:
 
- 2013: Version .6 In December Evan You created the first version of Vue.
- 2014: Version .8 First public release.
- 2015: Version 1 released
- 2016: Version 2 released
- 2020: Version 3 released
