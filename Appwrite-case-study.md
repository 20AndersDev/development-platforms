## Introduction

Appwrites is a backend service platform that is self-hosted and lets the developers create a secure open-source backend server, for both web and mobile. Appwrite provides APIs that developers can build with different tools, languages, and services, including user authentication, database management, storage, and Functions. Appwrite has 11 different programming languages with 12 different SDKs (Software Development Kits) where developers can select the language they are comfortable with. Using Appwrite allows the developer to easily create multiple databases, and organize your data into collections and documents with the Appwrite REST API, GraphQL, and Realtime API. It also supports a variety of frameworks like Flutter, React, Angular, Vue, and Svelte which makes Appwrite an adaptable platform for developers.


## Brief History

Appwrite first started in September 2019. It was formed by Founder and CEO Eldad Fux, first as a passion to solve the problems he was facing as a tech leader and software engineer. Appwrite was created to avoid the complexity of software development and serve as a consistent and predictable abstraction layer on top of traditional cloud solutions. Appwrite does not need to force the user to learn new skills, as it provides the APIs to build modern software projects by leaning on already existing protocols and developers' knowledge. The various Appwrite services have APIs for operating Authentication, Databases, Storage, Functions and more.

Appwrite was officially launched in 2021 and already won the Golden kitty award in 2022, which is an annual celebration to acknowledge and appreciate innovative products around the world. It has also been ranked as the number 2 product of the week and number one product of the day on Product Hunt. With its board of directors containing six people, including the founder, Appwrite also has +200 thousand community members according to its website. 


## Appwrite Database and Features

Appwrite databases let developers store application and users' data and fetch it using REST API. Appwrite REST API is built of a traditional NoSQL database which means it creates collections as containers of documents. Developers can also build databases with an SQL adapter, Appwrite will then make collections as tables and documents as rows on native SQL tables. You can also create databases with the Appwrite CLI or the Appwrite Server SDKs and can use different protocols to access the server, including REST API, GraphQL, and Realtime API.

By using the subscription method, Realtime API lets you listen to any events on the server-side. Developers don't have to request new data via HTTP, the subscription method will load the new data every time it changes. Realtime API allows users to receive the update almost immediately through a WebSocket connection. The WebSocket is a technology with an open two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server. With the realtime API, developers can build interactive user experiences by providing information from Appwrite's services in realtime. Developers can also access the Appwrite server using GraphQL. 



## Strengths

- Appwrite is an open-source project which makes it free to use and create web, app or server. It has a wide range of coding languages and frameworks which makes it an adaptable platform for developers.
- With Appwrite developers don't have to be concerned about handling servers or infrastructure. It uses a serverless architecture which can save developers time and resources to concentrate on building the application.
- Appwrite is designed to be easy to use and to meet developers where they are. With Appwrite developers can use Pink Design, Pink Design is Appwrite's open-source design system for building user interfaces. 
- Appwrite is a new upcoming open-source alternative for Firebase with good and explainable documentation. It has a large developer community that can help developers get started quickly with their project. 

## Weaknesses

- Appwrite can be a more complex platform compared to Firebase. It's a new platform with many coding languages which can make it a little overwhelming to get set up and maintain. 
- Appwrite is free to use and build but developers have to host with another platform which can make it a little more expensive. Appwrite is currently working on making hosting possible in the future. 
- As an upcoming platform, Appwrite has a smaller community of users and contributors compared to other platforms. Developers can find it difficult to solve issues or find answers to questions. 
- Appwrite has a lot of integrations with other technologies and services but other established platforms can have more pre-built integrations.
