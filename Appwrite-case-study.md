You don't have to request new data via HTTP, the subscription method will get the new data every time it changes. Realtime API let your client receives that update within milliseconds through a WebSocket connection. The WebSocket is a technology with open a two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server. Appwrite Realtime lets you build interactive and gives your users realtime experiences by delivering information from Appwrite's services in realtime.
