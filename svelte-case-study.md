## Introduction

Svelte is a javascript compiler, its similar to React, but react uses Virtual DOM and Svelte is a javascript Compiler, both provide a similar component-based architecture -- that means both enable a CDD bottom-up development, and both enable sharing their components between apps, via tools and platforms like [Github](www.github.com).

## Brief History

## Features

Svelte is purely a compiler, that converts your application into ideal JavaScript code when you build your application for production.

## Creating a project with svelte using vite

I am using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to create a new svelte there is other way's than vite, but im not gonna get into it. If you want a full-fledged app framework you can also use (https://svelte.dev/docs) it will also utilizing vite. But since im only gonna build a simple front-end only site/app, i will use svelte without kit.

You start by navigating to the folder where you want this project, then open a terminal in the folder and type this command and hit enter.

```
npm init vite@latest
```
You will then get prompted some options.

1. Write the project name, hit enter.

2. You will get options of frameworks, choose svelte.

3. you will get options for variant like javaScript, TypeScript or SvelteKit.

Im going to choose TypeScript, feel free to choose whatever floats your boat.

Go into the project folder `cd "name of your project"`.
Write this command in the terminal `code .` that will open the project in a new vscode session.
