## Introduction

Svelte is a javascript compiler, its similar to React, but react uses Virtual DOM and Svelte is a javascript Compiler, both provide a similar component-based architecture -- that means both enable a CDD bottom-up development, and both enable sharing their components between apps, via tools and platforms like [Github](www.github.com).

## Brief History

## Features

Svelte is purely a compiler, that converts your application into ideal JavaScript code when you build your application for production.

## Creating a project with svelte using vite

I am using vite to create a new svelte project since i like vite, you can also use rollup for this.

You start by navigating to the folder where you want this project, then open a terminal in the folder.

write

```
npm init vite@latest
```

and hit enter

1. Write the project name, hit enter.

2. You will get options of frameworks, choose svelte.

3. you will get options for variant like javaScript, TypeScript or SvelteKit.

Im going to choose TypeScript, feel free to choose freely.

## Strengths

- The building time is much faster when compared to react or even other frameworks.

- Binding classes and variables are relative easy, and custom logic is not needed when binding classes.
