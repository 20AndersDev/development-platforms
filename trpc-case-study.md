## Introduction

tRPC stands for TypeScript Remote Procedure Call. It's a simple and lightweight library for creating API's using a singular programming language [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), with the option to use a singular respoitory to host both the client and server infrastructure. It operates as a protocol to call your backend functions directly from the frontend, unlike other popular options such as ``GraphQL``.
## Brief History

tRPC was created by [Alex / KATT](https://twitter.com/alexdotjs) and was first released in 2020, with [tRPC/client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@trpc/client?activeTab=versions) and [tRPC/server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@trpc/server?activeTab=versions) seeing its 1.0.0 release back in 2020.

Since then there's been many iterations and versions of the product, with its latest version ``10.9.0`` being released 11th of Jan 2022.

Currently its latest versions is seeing around 40k weekly downloads and the repository has a respectable 20k stars on github. The interest in the product have increased recently in social media, and been praised by several prominent ``full-stack`` developers for it's features on how it bridges the gap between front- and backend.
