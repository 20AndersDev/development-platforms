## Introduction

MySQL is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), based on Structured Query Language (SQL). MySQL was originally developed and released on 23rd of May in 1995 by the swedish company MySQL AB, founded by David Axmark, Allan Larsson and Michael Widenius. MySQL was in 2008 bought by Sun Microsystems (later acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2010). MySQL is an open-source software that runs on most operating systems (OS).

## Main Features

MySQL is as mentioned a relational database management system (RDBMS) based on the structural query language (SQL) and is one of the most popular languages in the market for accessing and managing table records. MySQL is also a open-source and free software under the GNU license.

The following section describes some of the most important features and characteristics of the MySQL Database Software:

**Relational Database Management System (RDBMS):**
- MySQL is a relational database management system. This database language is based on the SQL queries to access and manage records of the table
**Easy to use:**
- MySQL is user-friendly and easy to learn. New users only have to get basic knowledge of SQL. And can build and interact with MySQL by using only a few simple SQL statements
**It is secure:**
- MySQL consists of a solid data security layer that protects sensitive data from intruders. Passwords are also encrypted in MySQL
**Client/Server Architecture:**
- MySQL follows the working of a client/server architecture. There is a server (MySQL) and arbitrarily many clients (application programs) which communicates with the server; that is, they can query data, save changes, etc.
**Free to download:**
- MySQL is a free-to-use software that users can download from www.mysql.com without any cost
**It is scalable:**
-
