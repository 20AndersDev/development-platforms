## Introduction

GitHub is an Internet hosting service for software development and version control using Git. it is a web based platform where users can store their code and colaborate together on a coding project. GitHub has a lot of great tools/features like github desktop, actions, project management, teams, etc.

## Brief History

github was founded in 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P.J. Hyett, and Scott Chacon. github has had an enormous growt since it was founded and today it is one of the most popular platforms for web hosting and code sharing. github's headquarters is based in San Francisco in the state of California, in the united states of america. the CEO of github is named Thomas Dohmke. github currently has about 2500 employees and in 2018 it had about 200-300 million USD of revenue.

### From the beginning to the present time (2023)

**github blooming**

- (year 2010) after only two years since it's launch github was hosting over 1 million repositories witch doubled a year later.
- (year 2011) in the period of January to May 2011 ReadWriteWeb reported that GitHub had surpassed SourceForge and Google Code in total number of commits.
- (year 2013) it was hosting 5 million repositories and had over 3 million users. before this year ended the ammount of repositories had dubbled again and it was now hosting over 10 million repositories.

**Finance**

- in 2012 Andreessen Horowitz invested 100 million USD in github with a valuation of 750 million USD.
- in 2015 GitHub raised another $250Â million of venture capital in a series B round. Investors were Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, and other venture capital funds. this round valued the company at about 2 billion USD

**International Expansion**

- in 2015 github opened its first office outside of the United States of America. the office was opened in japan.
- n 2016, GitHub was ranked No. 14 on the Forbes Cloud 100 list. It was not featured on the 2018, 2019, and 2020 lists.

**major attack**
in 2018 github fell victim to what was considered to be the third biggest DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack in history. the attack's traffic peaked at about 1.35 terrabits per second. As a respond to this GitHub expanded its GitHub Education by offering free education bundles to all schools.

**Acquisition by Microsoft**
Microsoft has since 2012 been using github to host open-source projects and development tools such as .NET Core, Chakra Core, MSBuild, PowerShell, PowerToys, Visual Studio Code, Windows Calculator, Windows Terminal and most of its product documentation (now to be found on Microsoft Docs). Microsoft announced on June 4Th 2018 that it intended to acquire GitHub for 7.5 billion USD. only months later on October 26, 2018. the deal was closed. Under Microsoft GitHub continued to operate independently as a community, platform and business. This acquisition was in line with Microsoft's business strategy under CEO Satya Nadella, which focused on cloud computing services, alongside the development of and contributions to open-source software. Concerns over the sale bolstered interest in competitors like: Bitbucket, GitLab and SourceForge. they reported that they had seen spikes in new users intending to switch from GitHub to their respective services. in 2019 github aquired Semmle, a code analysis tool, and in 2020 GitHub launched in India under the name GitHub India Private Limited. in 2020 it also aquired npm (Node Package Manager) for an undisclosed sum.

## Features

this is githubs key features:

- **Version Control**: version control is also known as revision control, source control, or source code management. it allows developers to monitor changes to their code and they can revert to previous versions if needed.

- **Team-Collaboration**: users can work together on the same project, inspect each others code, raise issues and make plans for the project.

- **Branches**: a user can start a new branch either from the main branch or a different branch. this allows the user to write new code for the project without adding it to the project itself. when new code is written on a new branch it can be merged into the main project. usually users make a pull request before merging.
  this system enables users to develop code on different versions of a project at the same time.

- **Pull requests**: when a user have made changes to a project's code on a sepparate branch, he can make a pull request. this is an important step in quality control where other developers can inspect the canges in the code. they do this to make sure that the code is bug free and has no issues. when it is determined that the code is safe it can be merged from this branch to it's parrent branch or to the main branch.

- **issues**: GitHub Issues can be used to track ideas, feedback, tasks, or bugs for work on GitHub. issues can be an important part of development as bugs and problems with the code arises developers can raise an issue and also assign the issue to spesific developers for fixing.

- **merging**: is adding new code to a project from a sepparate branch. usually this is done after a pull request.

- **Integration**: github allows for developers to use other programs in combinatiion with github. examples are: continuous integration systems, tools for project management and several IDEs.

- **GitHub Actions**: is a feature where you can add automated tasks to a project. the automated tasks can either be runed manually or be set to run at spesiffic points of developement such as when a pull request is made. github actions is very flexible and allows for lots of different programming languages and tools to be used with it.
  examples of github actions uasge: deploy to static pages, end to end testing and unit testing.

- **GitHub Pages**: can be used to host a web project directly from github. it is an easy way for developers to host a project and/or share details for a project.

- **GitHub Enterprise**: allows businesses to run their github projects on their own servers with additional security and access to more features like GitHub Enterprise API.
