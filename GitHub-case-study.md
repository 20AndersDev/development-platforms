As a respond to this GitHub expanded its GitHub Education by offering free education bundles to all schools.

**Acquisition by Microsoft**
Microsoft has since 2012 been using github to host open-source projects and development tools such as .NET Core, Chakra Core, MSBuild, PowerShell, PowerToys, Visual Studio Code, Windows Calculator, Windows Terminal and most of its product documentation (now to be found on Microsoft Docs). Microsoft announced on June 4Th 2018 that it intended to acquire GitHub for 7.5 billion USD. only months later on October 26, 2018. the deal was closed. Under Microsoft GitHub continued to operate independently as a community, platform and business. This acquisition was in line with Microsoft's business strategy under CEO Satya Nadella, which focused on cloud computing services, alongside the development of and contributions to open-source software. Concerns over the sale bolstered interest in competitors like: Bitbucket, GitLab and SourceForge. they reported that they had seen spikes in new users intending to switch from GitHub to their respective services. in 2019 github aquired Semmle, a code analysis tool, and in 2020 GitHub launched in India under the name GitHub India Private Limited. in 2020 it also aquired npm (Node Package Manager) for an undisclosed sum.
