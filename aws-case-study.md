## Introduction

Amazon Web Services was the first major cloud hosting service. Cloud Hosting is a service that uses 
the resources of a remote network of remote servers that
enables the website to use the resources of multiple servers, therefore resulting in a 
faster performance. This is a technology that splits
a physical server into multiple virtual machines that we call "cloud servers". 
Connecting these is what creates a single network for hosting a website. 

AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud computing platform that is provided by Amazon. AWS includes a mixture
of infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and packaged-software-as-a-service (SaaS). It is also important to note that 
the concept of cloud hosting was born together with AWS.

## Brief History

AWS was originally founded 2002 when they realized they had a significant advantage in form on infrastructure services,
and their ability to manage and scale their infrastructure realiabily and efficently. The first AWS hosting services was launched in 2006 when Amazon SQS 
became avaliable, shortly followed by the AWS offerings: S3, EC2, SQS is a B2B service used by many famous applications such 
as Netflix and Dropbox. These offerings pushed AWS to become a global player in cloud hosting platforms and reprecents the core of AWS.
AWS has just grown by then and is today the global lead in cloud hosting with a market share of 33%, and the total amout of services has grown to over 200 with a broad span of services ranging from storage, compute, machiene learning, loT, etc. 

- 2002 - 2005 - Amazon launches Amazon.com Web Service offering SOAP and XML interfaces.
- 2006 - 2008 - AWS began offering IT - infrastructure in form of web services. Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) and S3 (simple storage service) was launched.
                This reprecents the core of AWS.
- 2008 - AWS - biggest competition, Google App Engine is launched. AWS lauches Amazon CloudFront (CDN).
- 2008 - 2009 - AWS lauches S3 and EC2 in Europe making it more accessible to locally run their instances. This is a huge benefit for AWS.
- 2009 - AWS launches multiple new services: ELB, Auto Scaling, Amazon cloud Watch, Import/Export services, Virtual Private Cloud, Amazon Relational 
         Database Service, mySQL Databases. 
- 2010 - AWS Simple Notification Service, AWS CloudFormatiom, identity and Access Management launches. Amazon.com's retail web services is migrates to  AWS.
- 2012 - Amazon launches AWS markedplace. And Netflix open sources Chaos Monkey
- 2013 - Launches AWS CloudTrail. A web Service that records API calls. And AWS Launches in China, this is a big launch for AWS.
- 2014 - AWS launches Amazon Aurora a MySQL-compatible database.
- 2016 - Dropbox announces their use of AWS S3 for storage.
- 2021 - Amazon MemoryDB. An in-memory database with API compatible with that of Redis. 

## Features

In 2006 AWS began offering IaaS services and was one of the first companies to introduce a "pay-as-you-go" solution. This way
you only pay for what you need and nothing more. AWS offers different services that can be configured in defferent ways based on the user's needs. 
AWS contains a total of more than 200 services that are built to include compute, databases, infrastructure, management, application development and security.

Here are the different categories AWS offers:
• compute
• storage
• databases
• data management
• migration
• hybrid cloud
• networking
• development tools
• management
• monitoring
• security
• governance
• big data management
• analytics
  
• artificial intelligence (AI)
• mobile development
• messages and notification


AWS provides dozens of data centers that are spread across 87 different availability zones (a location that contains multiple physical data centers).
An AWS costumers decides for them selves how many availability zones thay need based on their needs when it comes to compliances, proximity to end
customers and availability optimization. 

AWS is mostly knows for their EC2 solution. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud is a service that provides virtual servers. EC2 offers dozens of instance types with different capacities and sizes. These are tailored spicifilcy on workload types and applications.
S3 is also one of AWS's core services and is shoer for Amazon Simple Storage Service. S3 provides a scalable obkect sstorage for data backup, collection and analytics, this is ehere a IT professional stores data and files it as S3 objects up to five GB. AWS offers various tools and services to help users migrate applications, databases, servers and data onto its public cloud.

AWS also offers services for developers to use command-line tools and software development kits to deploy and manage applications and services and are avaliable for a variety of platforms and programming languages: Android, C++, iOS, Java, Node.js, PHP, Python and Ruby:
• AWS Command Line Interface, which is Amazon's proprietary code interface;
• AWS Tools for PowerShell, which developers use to manage cloud services from Mac, Windows and Linux environments.
• AWS Serverless Application Model, which developers use to simulate an AWS environment to test functions of AWS Lambda, a compute service that lets     developers run code from over 200 AWS services and SaaS applications.

Amazon API Gateway is a tool that lets development teams create, manage and monitor custom applications progamming interfaces (APIs). This lets apllications access data and functionality from the back-end services. Developers can also store their code in GitHub using the AWS CodeCommit.


AWS offers many different tools and solutions for enterprises and software developers. And gives developers a good way to monitor and access the different services. 
AWS is avaliable to groups such as government agencies. education institutions. non profits and private organizations.


## Strengths

Amazon Web Services is a well rounded host cloud service that has many pors and suits many different usages. Fist of all AWS is flexible. reliable and cost effictive. There are so many different services and tools to best suit what you are looking for. This way you only play for what you need (pay-as-you-go). AWS offers a comprehensive, evolving platform that includes a mixture og IaaS, Paas and Saas.

One of the biggest benefits using AWS is its user-friendliness. AWS is a really easy platform to use that is designed for quck and secure access. AWS users can administrate and modify their data anytime they want. Due to the easiness of the platform users find it much more accessable then some of its competetors. 

AWS's flexibility is one of the reasons many choose to use their service as it lets you use the operating systems, programming languages, and wen applications that you are comfertable with using. Using AWS EC2 you are able to build you own virtual computing environment by setting up you the operating systems and applications that you prefer. 

AWS serves millions of clients in more than 200 countries over the world and offers the highest relianility for its users. AWS offers many services and tasks accuratly and offers many services for making it more reliable like being capable to automatically recover from a failure. AWS stores data in different availanility zones so that if one were to fail the users would still have their data intact. 

In any company that is data-driven security is one of the most important aspects. AWS provides a highly secure infrastructure to ensure the upper most privancy for yor data. In fact many other Cloud Hosting Services is built on AWS's infrastructure. 
• Here is the layers of AWS's security protocall:
• Data protection
• Identity and access management
• Infrastructure protection
• Threat detection and continuous monitoring
• Compliance and data privacy

## Weaknesses

The biggest and most noticable weaknesses about AWS consists of its limitations, lack of experts and price variations. 

AWS's limitations comes down to limitations regarding EC2 and security. The problem appears when companies using AWS will have default resources to use but when default resources limits vary from region to region it can cause a problem. Companies can request for more resources but still they do find it to be a disadvantage. 

There are only a few professionals skilled in AWS or any cloud provider therefore when companies use AWS infrastructure as their cloud computing they  find it lacking when they look to hire professionals to would for the cloud infrastructure. Many companies are ready to start using AWS, but need someone to work on AWS who can lead their organizations to cause higher performances. 

AWS prices varies depending on factors suck as cost of land, fiber, electricity and taxes from that specific region. Prices will also vary depending of you need for additional tech support. AWS offers three different packages to choose from, Developer, Business and Eterprice and the price varied accordingly between there three packages and the depending factors mantioned above.
