## Summary

A beginners guide to PostgreSQL also known as Postgres.
The video is also intended as a short tutorial for psql, an interactive shell for Postgres.
The video covers installation (for Mac), creating database and basic SQL syntax in 12 minutes.

This case study is intended as a video counterpart to the detailed written [postgres-case-study](./postgres-case-study.md) by Adrian Brandshaug and reflects the authors comment about challenges for beginners.
This case study also responds to the lack of video tutorial for psql as opposed to the numbers of video tutorials for pgAdmin(GUI for Postgres).

The content of the case study is largely based on the other YouTube tutorial listed as reference below. However this case study is not intended as a full course for PostgreSQL, but rather as quick introduction, which beginners can casually watch it through in 12 minutes and be interedted in learning further.
