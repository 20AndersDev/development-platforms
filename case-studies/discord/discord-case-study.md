## Introduction

## Brief History

You may use a bullet point list or subheadings to structure a timeline of your chosen topic's history:

#### 2011: In the beginning...

- Jason Citron sold OpenFeint (Social gaming platform for mobile games) to GREE in 2011 for 104 Million USD, which he used to found Hammer & Chisel.
- Citron with his FFXIV and League of Legends team had difficulty communicating tactics and strategies with the available free VoIP software at the time.
- This led to the development of a chat service with a focus on `user friendliness` with minimal impact on `performance`.

#### 2015:

- Discord opened a public beta in March.
- Discord was publicly released in May under the domain name discordapp.com.
- Discord became widely used by e-sports and LAN tournament gamers. The company benefited from relationships with Twitch streamers and subreddit communities for Diablo and World of Warcraft.

#### 2016:

- In January Hammer & Chisel reported that Discord had been used by 3 million people, with growth of 1 million per month, reaching 11 million users in July that year.
- By December the company reported it had 25 million users worldwide.

#### 2017:

- By the end of 2017, the service had drawn nearly 90 million users, with roughly 1.5 million new users each week.
- The company observed that while the bulk of its servers are used for gaming-related purposes, `a small number have been created by users for non-gaming activities, like stock trading, fantasy football, and other shared interest groups.`
- Video calling and screen sharing were added in October 2017, allowing users to create private video calls with up to 10 users.
- Starting October 2017, Discord allows game developers and publishers to verify their servers. Verified servers, like verified accounts on social media sites, have badges to mark them as official communities.

#### 2018:

#### 2019:

- Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the popularity of the video calls the limit of users increased from 10 to 50.
- In August 2019, the video/screen sharing feature was further expanded with live streaming channels in servers. A user can share their entire screen, or a specific application, and others in that channel can choose to watch the stream.
