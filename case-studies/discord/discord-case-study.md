## Introduction

Discord is a social communication platform developed by gamers for gamers that operates through instant messages, video calls and VoIP (Voice over IP).
Users create their own servers that host text/voice channels which are used by the community for communication, access to the server can be public or only given through link/direct invitations by the moderator(s)/owner of the server.

## Brief History

#### 2011: In the beginning...

- Jason Citron sold OpenFeint (Social gaming platform for mobile games) to GREE in 2011 for 104 Million USD, which he used to found Hammer & Chisel.
- Citron with his FFXIV and League of Legends team had difficulty communicating tactics and strategies with the available free VoIP software at the time.
- This led to the development of a chat service with a focus on `user friendliness` with minimal impact on `performance`.

#### 2015:

- Discord opened a public beta in March.
- Discord was publicly released in May under the domain name discordapp.com.
- Discord became widely used by e-sports and LAN tournament gamers.
- The company benefited from relationships with Twitch streamers and subreddit communities for Diablo and World of Warcraft.

#### 2016: Baby steps...

- January: Hammer & Chisel reported that Discord had been used by 3 million people, with growth of 1 million per month, reaching 11 million users in July that year.
- Discord raised an additional $20 million in funding, including an investment from WarnerMedia (then TimeWarner).
- December: The company reported it had 25 million users worldwide.

#### 2017:

- January: Discord launches the first subscription service called `Discord Nitro` for $4.99. This allowed users to get an animated avatar, use custom and/or animated emojis across all servers, an increased maximum file size on file uploads (from 8 MB to 50 MB), the ability to screen share in higher resolutions (This was added in October with the launch of the feature), the ability to choose their own personal identification number and a unique profile badge.
- The company observed that while the bulk of its servers are used for gaming-related purposes, `a small number have been created by users for non-gaming activities, like stock trading, fantasy football, and other shared interest groups.`
- Video calling and screen sharing were added in October 2017, allowing users to create private video calls with up to 10 users.
- Starting October 2017, Discord allows game developers and publishers to verify their servers. Verified servers, like verified accounts on social media sites, have badges to mark them as official communities.
- By the end of 2017, the service had drawn nearly 90 million users, with roughly 1.5 million new users each week.

#### 2018:

- August: Discord launched a games storefront beta, allowing users to purchase a curated set of games through the service.
- October: `Discord Nitro` was renamed `Discord Nitro Classic` with the introduction of the new `Discord Nitro`, which cost $9.99 and included access to free games through the Discord game store.
- December: The company announced it had raised $150 million in funding at a $2 billion valuation. The round was led by Greenoaks Capital with participation from Firstmark, Tencent, IVP, Index Ventures and Technology Opportunity Partners.

#### 2019:

- Due to the `COVID-19` pandemic and the popularity of the video calls the limit of users increased from 10 to 50.
- August: The video/screen sharing feature was further expanded with live streaming channels in servers. A user can share their entire screen, or a specific application, and others in that channel can choose to watch the stream.
- WarnerMedia Investment Group was shut down and acquired by AT&T, selling its equity.

#### 2020:

- June: Discord announced it was shifting focus away from video gaming specifically to a more all-purpose communication and chat client for all functions, revealing its new slogan "Your place to talk", along with a revised website.
- Among other planned changes would be to reduce the number of gaming in-jokes it uses within the client, improving the user `onboarding experience`, and increasing server `capacity` and `reliability`. The company announced it had received an additional `$100 million in investments` to help with these changes.

#### 2021: ...to giant strides.

- March: Discord announced it had hired its first finance chief, former head of finance for Pinterest `Tomasz Marcinkowski`.
- July: Discord acquired `Sentropy`, a internet moderation company.
- August: Discord had reported $130 million in 2020 revenues, triple from the prior year, and had an estimated valuation of $15 billion.
- September: Google sent cease and desist notices to the developers of two of the most popular music bots used on `Discord–Groovy` and `Rythm`–which were used on an estimated 36 million servers in total. These bots allowed users to request and play songs in a voice channel, taking the songs from YouTube ad-free.
- November: Citron posted mockup images of Discord around the proposed Web3 principles with integrated cryptocurrency and non-fungible token support, leading to criticism from its userbase.
