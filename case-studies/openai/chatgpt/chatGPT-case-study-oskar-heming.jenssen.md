## Introduction

ChatGTP is an artifical intelligence chatbot developed by the research laboratory OpenAI and launched as a prototype in november 30, 2022. ChatGPT is part of the Generative Pre-trainer Transformer (GPT) family of language models, which refers to how ChatGPT processes requests and formulates responses.

## Brief history

    - December 2015: OpenAI is created as a non-profit organization focused on advancing    digital intelligence.
    - June 2018: GPT-1 is released
    - Februrary 2019: GPT-2 is released.
    - November 2022:  ChatGPT is launched as a free service based on the GPT-3.5 model. After five days, it had gained more than a million users.

## Main Features

In short, ChatGPT is created to is designed to provide information, descriptions, answers and solutions to complex questions through a conversational interface. Some key feature include: - Conversational AI: ChatGPT is designed to generate responses in a conversational context, allowing it to be used in chatbots and other AI applications. - Language translation: ChatGPT can translate text from one language to another, making it useful for multilingual applications. - Text completion: ChatGPT can be used to generate text based on partial input, allowing it to be used for tasks such as writing assistance and content generation.

Above is some of the unique features that seperates ChatGPT from other chatbots like its conversational skills and mulitlingual abilites. Other unique features is that it can remember various questions to continue the conversation in a more fluid manner. This helps the with providing context for the bot and uses it as information for the conversation.

Within the world of developement, ChatGPT can be used as a tool to explain programming languages and complicated concepts in a simple manner or even write the code itself. You can use it to produce snippets of code, short or long, although large chunks of code are usually more prone to error. Another area of use is to double check your code and helping with finding/solving bugs and errors. It supports languages different languages like Python, Java, C++, JavaScript and PHP, just to name a few.

In this way it can speed up the developement process and effectiveness. Other real world uses include solving math problems, writing job applications, rephrasing paragraphs of text and so on.

## How it works

ChatGPT generates human-like text using a complex algorithm called Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). GPT is a type of large language model (LLM) that uses deep learning to analyze patterns in data sequences and generate new text based on the input it receives. They are called "generative" because they can generate new text based on the input they receive, "pretrained" because they are trained on a large corpus of text data before being fine-tuned for specific tasks, and "transformers" because they use a transformer based neural network architecture to process input text and generate output text.

The GPT used by OpenAI is a fine-tuned model that is available for free, is based on the GPT-3.5 model which has been built using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. This is a concept in machine learning where machines are "trained" using a reward system to optimzie its behaviour. A human client will sit and ask questions to the computer, the computer answers, and the human provides feedback, which the machine uses to adjust its responses.

## Market comparison

### Pros

    - As of now, the ChatGPT that uses the GPT-3.5 model is free of charge for everyone. It's important to note that this may change as ChatGPT is in a research and feedback collection phase. There is a version that uses the GPT-4 model which you can pay a monthly fee for. Cost varies compared to other chatbots like for example YouChat and ChatBing being free, although being free may come with a catch like a limited free trial or having to sign up on a waiting list.
    - A big thing with ChatGPT is its human like responses and ability to explain complex topics in a simple manner. This is one ChatGPT's biggest selling points, though its not alone as other bots like Jasper are also known for this.

### Cons

    - Due to its popularity, the free version often has a lot of traffic and therefore may be unavailable. The paid version does give general access even when theres a high demand. Since it has to do with ChatGPT being one the most popular bots, you are less likely to experience this with other exisitng chatbots.
    - ChatGPT has been trained using existing material up to 2021. This means that its not up to speed with events after that year, so it can provide outdated information. ChatGPT does not have access to the internet so it cant just fetch new information whereas some other bots like YouChat and ChatBing do have that feature.
    - In contrast to ChatBing and Youchat, ChatGPT does not provide sources or references to factual statements.

## Getting started

Here is a simple guide for getting started with ChatGPT, provided with a small example of how to use it to make a simple static page.

1. Go to chat.openai.com
2. Press 'Sign up'
3. Write your email and password and sign up
4. Verify your account
5. On verification you will be redirected to the 'Home' page.
6. You can now ask ChatGPT whatever you like.

The following is an example of how to use ChatGPT in developement. Let's say we want to create a form with some simple demands. In general,you want to write effective prompts to get the answers you want. Also, the more specific you are, the better ChatGPT understands what you want.

Since ChatGPT remembers the whole conversation, you can use this to provide context for future questions. Let's start with telling to act as a front-end developer and write the code we need.

ChatGPT writes all the HTML and JavaScript. In addition it provides an explanation of what it does. This is the result when putting the code into a boilerplate HTML file and opening it up with live-server:

![Skjermbilde 2023-04-25 kl  10 48 00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95288100/234257984-62457fbb-c6e6-4c75-bb64-77e642906a0f.png)

Success-message when filling out the form:

![Skjermbilde 2023-04-25 kl  10 48 20](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95288100/234258059-9463f38b-1bb3-4e1b-9dc1-86490e7f9d90.png)

At the moment it's a very basic-looking form, so here I ask ChatGPT to style it with CSS.

![Skjermbilde 2023-04-25 kl  11 15 03](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95288100/234258488-b32916c7-aa0e-4ee3-9b22-8a33eaa6c22b.png)

![Skjermbilde 2023-04-25 kl  11 15 13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95288100/234258529-dc377497-2da8-4e19-8ee7-ae6aec766297.png)

![Skjermbilde 2023-04-25 kl  11 15 24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95288100/234258596-b8b8d17a-7df1-47a0-ab2d-e830e173a137.png)

ChatGPT provides the CSS along with another explanation of what it does. The page now looks like this:

![Skjermbilde 2023-04-25 kl  11 17 12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95288100/234258719-78fa7c4f-5402-4d3f-b583-93ebbadeaed3.png)

It did what we asked, although in my head, I imagined the labels would be left aligned. Also, the success-message still appears in the top -left corner. It makes sense since that it appears like this, since I technically only asked it to style the position of the form. This is where you can see that it pays off to be as specific as possible. So we are gonna ask it to style it a little further one last time.

![Skjermbilde 2023-04-25 kl  11 27 54](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95288100/234259240-9f84294c-a281-45db-96d2-dc76a3825d8b.png)

![Skjermbilde 2023-04-25 kl  11 28 11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95288100/234259279-32f537dc-3553-40f1-b59a-d1b2087fac1a.png)

New result:

![Skjermbilde 2023-04-25 kl  11 30 27](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95288100/234260320-31ea7bf0-c0d9-43e0-a2d1-336405b14fdd.png)

![Skjermbilde 2023-04-25 kl  11 30 56](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95288100/234260347-5489f60b-a5ba-492e-b73f-bf31e81fe362.png)

The labels are now left-aligned. The idea was actually to have it left-aligned with the input elements, but this demonstrates the need for specificity and writing good prompts, since technically it did what was asked. In all this took only three prompts, and shows how easy and fast ChatGPT can help with developement.

## Conclusion

ChatGPT is a powerful tool to use in different situations. In this case study, we try to demonstrate how it can be a useful tool in web and software developement. It is important to be aware of the limitations of ChatGPT and that it can be wrong. Therefore you should be aware of how to interact with ChatGPT to get the desired results. It can save time and a lot of frustration, and you can also learn alot from it. An overreliance however can end up backfiring as you may not end up learning too much, so its important to use with caution. ChatGPT along with other AI products are definetely here to stay, but instead of fearing the worst, we can learn how to use it to our advantage and let it enhance our own work.
