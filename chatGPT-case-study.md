# ChatGPT - A case study

## Introduction

ChatGPT is a natural language processing tool driven by artificial intelligence technology. It has the ability to answer open ended questions and assist with tasks such as composing emails and job application letters, translating phrases to and from various languages, creating workouts or meal plans, and even produce code in several programming languages. Since its release in late November 2022 it has astonished users with its human-like answers as well as raised concerns in many who see their jobs threatened in the near future.

Technically speaking, ChatGPT is a large language model. It means that it was trained to predict the next most likely occurring word in a given sentence, much like the text prediction function of a mobile phone. The key difference is that this chatbot's input comes from hundreds of billions of words from a diverse range of sources including, news articles, websites, and books. GPT stands for generative pre-trained transformer.

## Brief History

The history of ChatGPT itself is very short. However, there are previous relevant events that give a more complete insight of the context of its introduction.

- 23rd March 2016. Microsoft releases Tey, a Twitter chat bot that was shut down shortly after because it learnt offensive language.

- 11th June 2018. OpenAI releases "Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training", a paper presenting the differences between natural language processing (NLP) models and Generative Pre-Training (GPT).

- November 2019. OpenAI launches GPT-2 as a "direct scale-up" of GPT.

- July 2020. GPT-3 is introduced in beta testing mode.

- 22nd September 2020. Microsoft announces exclusive licensed use of GPT-3, although others can still benefit from the public API.

- 29th June 2021. GitHub releases GitHub Copilot, developed in collaboration with OpenAI and based on GPT-3.

- 5th August 2022. Meta launches Blenderbot 3, the company's most advanced AI chatbot to date.

- 30th November 2022. OpenAI launches ChatGPT based on GPT-3.5 model. Within 5 days of its realease it gained 1 million users whereas other successful applications needed months to achieve the first million users. For instace, Netflix achieved its first million in 40 months, Facebook in 10 months, and Instagram in 2.5 months.

## Features

Because it has the ability to remember previous questions asked in the same chat and is able to ask follow up questions when it needs more context, ChatGPT can effectively interact with a human being in a conversational way. The model was trained on a massive amount of corpus data including a wide array of topics and styles which makes its potential uses so vast it will be challenging to summarise them all in one report.

As the bot is able to produce human-fashion texts in several languages it can be employed to write essays, poems, bed-time stories, news articles, and even scientific abstracts. These last ones might not contain reliable information, but the text bot is able to mimic academic language perfectly. It can also correct grammar, explain complex ideas in simple terms, and solve mathematical problems making it a suitable tool for students who need assistance in their assignments or simply use it to cheat on their school work.

One of the most relevant features when it comes to web and software development is its ability to produce code snippets in different programming languages including JavaScript, Java, Python, C++, C#, and Ruby. A myriad videos can be found on YouTube with influencers explaining how the text bot built entire apps for them, but it is worth mentioning that the code usually contains bugs or it isn't completely accurate. Therefore, the building process requires a human developer behind it who can either debug themselves or can give further instructions to ChatGPT to fix its own bugs. Nevertheless, the bot has proven to be an exceptional debugging assistant tool. As tackling code issues involves a lot of time spent on reading documentation, google searches, and stackoverflow, ChatGPT increases tremendously developers productivity by providing possible solutions in a matter of seconds. All it takes is copy/paste the block of code in the chat line and explain what it is supposed to do and what error is throwing.

ChatGPT is currently free to use. OpenAI has announced on Twitter that it's piloting a subscription plan that offers faster response times and reliability during peak hours. At the time of writing this report, the plan costs $20 / month. The free tier will still be available to the public.

## Strengths

ChatGPT can be universally used. It isn't limited to English speakers for it supports many different languages. Users' age doesn't appear to be a limitation either given its ability to explain complex concepts in simple terms. Additionally, it can assist people in their personal life by outlying meal plans or help organise their days, but it can also aid in a variety of industries like journalism, education, business development, and software development. This makes it a very versatile tool.

Focusing on software development, its ability to increase developers productivity is definitely its greatest strength. If the tool is used appropriately it can help us be more efficient by decreasing the time we spent planning or reading how to do something.
