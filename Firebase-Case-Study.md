## Introduction

Firebase provides users easy access to app authentication, databases, hosting and a handfull of other usefull features.
This makes maintaining the app wuite alot easier then if you would do it by yourself!

## Brief History Year by Year

### 2012
Firebase launched to the public april 2012.
It launched with the Firebase Realtime Database, a solution that synchronies data across multiple platforms including mobile apps and web apps!

### 2014
Firebase launched 2 new products to it's users, Firebase Hosting and Authentication, this made Firebase a "MBaaS" short for "mobile backend as a service", more commonly known as backend as a service, which is a solution that provides mobile apps and web apps developers a way to integrate their application with push notifications and messaging services. 

In october 2014 Google acquired Firebase

### 2015

Google acquired the company "Divshot" and merged Divshot with Firebase

### 2016

At Google I/O (Google's conference for showing that's coming) they announced Firebase Analytics.
Firebase also integrates with google services such as Google Cloud Platform and Google Ads.
Google acquired more company's and merged them with Firebase, these companys are
LaunchKit and Crashlytics.

## Features

Firebase's Key Features are:

- Cloud Messaging
- Authentication
- Test Lab
- Hosting
- Remote Configuration
- Dynamic Links
- Crash Reporting
- Real-time Database
- Storage

## Strengths

- Authentication is secure and can be done by email and password, facebook and other SSO methods.
- Provides realtime data to the developer.
- API is easy to integrate and has really good documentation official and community documentation
By community documentation i mean solutions to error messages on sites such as github and stackoverflow!
- File backup is done by using Google Cloud

## Weaknesses

- Support for iOS development is limited compared to Android
- Focuses mostly on Android apps & services
- limited data migration

## Comparison

### AWS (Amazon Web Services)
- Firebase is faster then AWS
- Also cheaper then AWS
- AWS also has easy setup and integration, it also has a big library of different choices the developer can pick from when it comes to hardware.
- AWS is quite expensive as it's pay per use. It calculates cost based on traffic.

## Summary

Firebase is a great choice if your application needs a database, and if you lack the needed backend knowledge to host the database and such.
It makes it easy and fast to set up, something that would previously take quite a while to get right.
The overview you get by using Firebase is amazing, and is without a doubt the best in the business at the time of writing this.
Considering the community support Firebase has aswell you rarley get stuck on a error message as it's almost guaranteed that other developer
have encounterd that error aswell, making it easy to solve and move on.
